# Bughunt - Cops Week'25

The Bug Hunt, organized by the Club of Programmers (COPS) IIT (BHU) Varanasi, is a unique debugging and code improvement challenge as part of COPS Week. In this event, participants will be given a deliberately buggy website filled with issues related to functionality, performance, security, and code quality.

The objective is to identify and fix bugs, refactor the code, and improve the implementation. Participants will compete to resolve as many issues as possible within the given time frame. For every day, a different codebase is alloted.

This event is designed to sharpen debugging skills, enhance problem-solving abilities, and promote clean coding practices. Whether youâ€™re a beginner learning the ropes of debugging or an experienced coder refining your skills, the Bug Hunt is the perfect playground to test your expertise and improve real-world codebases!

- Instructions to setup **Day 1-2** are in the file `Day_1-2/SETUP.md`

### Rules

- This is strictly a solo event. Team participation is not allowed.
- Participants must download the ZIP file from the official GitHub repository.
- **Making Pull requests is not allowed** (so that other participants can't copy the solutions)
- All fixes, refactoring, and improvements of the issues should be done in a **private GitHub repository created by the participant, which should be made public after the event** (and submit on unstop later).
- Participants earn points based on successful fixes, code improvements, and overall code quality.
- Submission must be made before the deadline to be considered for evaluation.
- Participants must work independently. Collaboration, external help, or sharing of solutions is not allowed.
- Only changes relevant to the **identified issues in the ISSUES tab** will be considered; unnecessary modifications may be ignored.
- If you see any new bug in the site, identify them and write them in a file (preferrably markdown as ISSUES.md at root). Identification and solving of bugs have individual points.
- In case of any disputes, the decision of the organizers will be final and binding.
- Points scored in BugHunt will directly be added to the score of the main DebugIt event.
- Update your local setup every day by pulling the main repo to solve the challenges of respective day.

- Ask for any clarifications regarding an issue in that respective opened issue itself on the GitHub.
