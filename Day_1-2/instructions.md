- **Making Pull requests is not allowed** (so that other participants can't copy the solutions)

- You have to solve the issues by **making change in your local setup**, and you can also add new issues (if you found) which carries respective extra points for finding and more points for solving the issue too.

- After the end of the event, you have to submit your local repo in the form of a zip file with mentioned issues solved and created (add new issues found in a file ISSUES.md at root of the repository).
